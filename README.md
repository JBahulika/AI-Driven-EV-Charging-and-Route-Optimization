# 🔋 AI-Driven EV Charging and Route Optimization System

## 🚀 Overview
With the rapid adoption of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**, challenges such as **charging congestion**, **range anxiety**, and **grid imbalance** are becoming increasingly significant.  
This project presents an **AI-powered system** designed to optimize **EV charging**, **routing**, and **energy management** using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** techniques.  

The system intelligently predicts charging demand, recommends energy-efficient routes, and dynamically adjusts pricing to balance grid load — all visualized through an interactive dashboard.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
As the number of EVs grows, charging infrastructure struggles to meet demand efficiently.  
Drivers often experience **long wait times**, **sub-optimal route planning**, and **high energy costs** due to grid overload.  
Current systems lack real-time intelligence for predicting demand, optimizing routes, or managing energy dynamically.
